# Hey, I'm Meghraj

Software engineer and problem solver.

Full-stack engineer, working on building scalable web applications to classic backend systems. I'm good at developing and designing anything from web apps to complex high-performance backends and more.

I started from building simple HTML pages to creating React Native apps, web apps, and backend systems.

Nowadays, I'm tinkering with Gen AI, RAG, and vector databases â€” exploring prompt engineering to find solutions to problems using AI.

My professional stack lies in JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node, and NestJS.
